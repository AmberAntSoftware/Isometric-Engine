A simple way to display and interact with a 45,45,0 map


This will contain templates for java, javascript, C, and C++


>>Before beginning:
>>The graphics are assumed to be already rendered in such a way, as to mimic a 45,45,0(x,y,z degree) cube
>>There are many ways to improve performance, notably adding clipping rules ro the total map (a 64x64x16 map has 65536 tiles!)
